<h3>Netted Agency Flows</h3>

<p>
    A client comes to us to buy (Order) Vodafone shares. We fill the order with a number of executions on the
    Market. Once the executions are complete, we then allocate the 'filled' order according to the client's preferences.

    From an operational perspective:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>on the client side, the allocations would be confirmed and be settled directly</li>
    <li>on the market side, the executions would be netted through our Market Constituent and we would be informed of
        the net
    </li>
    <li>on the market side, we would receive details from the CCP (Central Counterparty) about the way that these
        executions would net together
    </li>
    <li>on both the market and client side, we would report all of the trades to the regulator</li>
</ul>
<p>
    So for example:
</p>

<div class="scenario" cp:scenario="Customer orders BUY of 100m VODA shares">
    <h4>Customer orders BUY 100m VODA shares</h4>

    <p>With an buy order of 100m VODA, we might execute and allocate as below:</p>
    <table ccdn:execute="createBookingReportsWith(#flow, #quantity)">
        <tr>
            <th ccdn:set="#flow">Flow</th>
            <th ccdn:set="#quantity">Quantity (m)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>13</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>17</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>31</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>32</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Allocation</td>
            <td>50</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Allocation</td>
            <td>50</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Flow processing</h4>

    <p>The processing of the flows takes place on two separate dates: Trade Date and Value Date (Intended Settlement
        Date).</p>

    <p>The following will happen on Trade Date triggered by notifications from the Middle Office:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span ccdn:assertEquals="checkThatFundingHasBeenUpdatedWithPending(#TEXT)">funding is updated</span> to
            reflect the pending transactions that are due to move on Value Date
        </li>
        <li><span ccdn:assertEquals="checkOpenSettlementRiskPosted(#TEXT)">the ledgers are updated</span> to reflect the
            open settlement risk
        </li>
        <li><span ccdn:assertEquals="checkBicBalances(#TEXT)">the booking integrity is checked</span> to ensure that the
            market and client (allocations vs executions) match
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following will happen on Value Date, triggered by notification of Settlement completion from the Agent
        bank:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span ccdn:assertEquals="checkThatFundingHasBeenUpdatedWithSettled(#TEXT)">funding is updated</span> to
            reflect that the
            pending transactions have settled
        </li>
        <li><span ccdn:assertEquals="checkCloseSettlementRiskPosted(#TEXT)">the ledgers are updated</span> to close the
            open settlement risk and move the values to the Notro and Depot accounts
        </li>
    </ul>
