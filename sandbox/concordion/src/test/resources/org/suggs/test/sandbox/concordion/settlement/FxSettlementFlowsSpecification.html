<h1>FX Settlement Flows</h1>

<p>
    FX Trades are agreements between two parties to exchange different currencies as agreed rates, for example
    buying GBP using USD. Trades of this type need to be settled to the customers accounts. In some instances
    the accounts are held with us (we are the custodians of these accounts). If we are the custodian of the
    account no physical monies need to be transfered as we will simply debit/credit the customers accounts. If,
    however, one or more of the accounts are not stored with us then we will need to move monies across the customer's
    nostro accounts through the physical transfer of monies.

    <p>
        A number of methods exist for settling obligations to settle.  For each differing settlement method, different
        activities will be required to fully settle the obligation.  At a high level settlements need to do a range of
        the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Cash Management to populate the Nostros</li>
            <li>Accounting to the books and records</li>
            <li>Managing settlement risk</li>
            <li>Payments/receipts across Nostros</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        In the booking of trades, we expect that the vast majority will be booked correctly first time and that no
        changes are required to the booking.  However, we additionally expect that a number will also be booked
        incorrectly.  In the case where a trade has been booked incorrectly there are two options:
        <ol>
            <li>Amend the trade: if the change is not an economic change</li>
            <li>Cancel the trade: if the change is an economic (assumption is that the trade is rebooked)</li>
        </ol>
