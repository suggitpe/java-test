<h3>Cross Currency Flow</h3>

<p>
    A client comes to us to buy (Order) Vodafone shares. We fill the order with a number of executions on the Market in
    GBP, but the Client wants to settle in USD. Once the executions are complete, the Salesman requests a FX trader to
    convert the USD that the Client will pay to us to the GBP that we will pay to the market. The FX Trader provides an
    Exchange Rate, so that the Settlement Amount in USD can be calculated.

    From an operational perspective:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>on the client side, the allocations would be confirmed and be settled directly in USD</li>
    <li>on the market side, the executions would be settled directly in GBP</li>
    <li>on the client side, UBS Cash Equities would trade out the FX exposure to the FX stream</li>
    <li>on both the market and client side, we would report all of the trades to the regulator</li>
</ul>

<p>
    So for example:
</p>

<div class="scenario" cp:scenario="Customer orders BUY of 100m VODA shares">
    <h4>Customer orders BUY 100m VODA shares</h4>

    <p>With an buy order of 100m VODA, we might execute and allocate as below:</p>
    <table ccdn:execute="createBookingReportsWith(#flow, #quantity, #currency)">
        <tr>
            <th ccdn:set="#flow">Flow</th>
            <th ccdn:set="#quantity">Quantity (m)</th>
            <th ccdn:set="#currency">Settlement Currency</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>70</td>
            <td>GBP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Execution</td>
            <td>30</td>
            <td>GBP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Allocation</td>
            <td>60</td>
            <td>USD</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Allocation</td>
            <td>40</td>
            <td>USD</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Flow processing</h4>

    <p>
        The processing of the flows takes place on two separate dates: Trade Date and Value Date (Intended Settlement
        Date).
    </p>

    <p>The following will happen on Trade Date triggered by notifications from the Middle Office:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a Confirmation is sent to the Client advising them of the financials of the Trade and the FX made on their
            behalf
        </li>
        <li>funding is updated to reflect the pending transactions that are due to move on Value Date in the 2 different
            currencies
        </li>
        <li>the settlement instructions are issued in the correct currency (GBP for Market side, USD for Client side)
        </li>
        <li>the ledgers are updated to reflect the open settlement risk in the correct currency (GBP for Market side,
            USD for Client side)
        </li>
        <li>the ledgers are updated to reflect the internal FX risk transfer between Cash Equities and FX business</li>
        <li>the booking integrity control is checked to ensure that the total market and client (allocations vs
            executions) match per instrument
        </li>
        <li>the FX control is checked to ensure that the FX exposure has been covered</li>
        <li>the Settlement Matching control is checked to ensure that the Market and Client Trades are matched at the
            settlement venue
        </li>
        <li>the Open Settlement feeds are checked to ensure that Market and Client Trades are included</li>
        <li>the Finance feeds are checked to ensure that the ledger movements and balances are updated</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following will happen on Value Date, triggered by notification of Settlement completion from the Agent
        bank:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>funding is updated to reflect that the pending transactions have settled</li>
        <li>the ledgers are updated to close the open settlement risk and move the values to the Nostro and Depot
            accounts
        </li>
        <li>the Depot and Nostro controls are checked to ensure that the positions in the ledger match the positions at
            the agent/ICSD
        </li>
        <li>the Finance feeds are checked to ensure that the ledger movements and balances are updated</li>
        <li>the Open Settlement feeds are checked to ensure that Market and Client Trades are no longer included</li>

    </ul>
