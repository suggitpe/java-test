    <h3>Process settlement requests for a range of trade states</h3>

    <p>
        In the booking of trades, we expect that the vast majority will be booked correctly first time and that no
        changes are required to the booking. However, we additionally expect that a number will also be booked
        incorrectly. In the case where a trade has been booked incorrectly there are two options:
        <ol>
            <li>Amend the trade: if the change is not an economic change</li>
            <li>Cancel the trade: if the change is an economic (assumption is that the trade is rebooked)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    For example the following are the supported set of event types:
    <ul>
        <li cp:scenario="New"><span ccdn:assertEquals="processSettlementForEventTypeOf(#TEXT)">New</span> events</li>
        <li cp:scenario="Amend"><span ccdn:assertEquals="processSettlementForEventTypeOf(#TEXT)">Amend</span> events</li>
        <li cp:scenario="Cancel"><span ccdn:assertEquals="processSettlementForEventTypeOf(#TEXT)">Cancel</span> events</li>
    </ul>
