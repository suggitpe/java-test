    <h3>Process settlement requests for a range of trade states</h3>

    <p>
        In the booking of trades, we expect that the vast majority will be booked correctly first time and that no
        changes are required to the booking. However, we additionally expect that a number will also be booked
        incorrectly. In the case where a trade has been booked incorrectly there are two options:
    <ol>
        <li>Amend the trade: if the change is not an economic change</li>
        <li>Cancel the trade: if the change is an economic (assumption is that the trade is rebooked)</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
