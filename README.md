# Java Test
This repo contains a number of examplified test tools against some basic testable (ie have behaviour) domain objects.

## Test tools covered
The following test tools are covered by this repo:
* Concordion (plus & extensions)
* Cucumber
* JBehave

This is not a rant about which tool is better, it merely works as a demonstration of the differences.
