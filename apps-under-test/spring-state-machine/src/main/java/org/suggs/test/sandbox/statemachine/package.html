This is the top level package for the State Machine Library. This
library has been taken as a modified adaptation of Patric Fornasier's
State Machine variant. It focuses on delegation of the state machine
functionality to the correct level.
<br />
This package contains the following:
<ul>
	<li>State Machine - used as the focal point of the client to
	understand the current state and to initiate a state change</li>
	<li>State - the underlying states that will understand that they
	can transition between states, but not how</li>
	<li>State Transitions - these are the connectors between the
	states and have encapsulated responsibility to work out whether they
	are valid transitions</li>
</ul>
